#  Algorithms and Data Structures  ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=odilov.algo)

This repository contains examples of many popular algorithms, data structures and solutions to competitive programming problems.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

This project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes
only, and it is **not** meant to be used for production.
