#  Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading.

This project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes
only, and it is **not** meant to be used for production.

### Algorithms

* **Math**
  * `C++` [Binary Exponentiation](math/fast-powering/) - Fast Powering
* **Strings**
  * `C++` [Palindrome](strings/palindrome) - Check string for palindrome
* **Searches**
  * `C++` [Linear Search](search/linear-search)
* **Image Processing**
  * `.py` [HLS](imgage-processing) - HLS color segmentation

## Data Structures

* **Trie**
  * `C++` [Construction](trie/construction) - trie construction
  * `C++` [Trie](trie/search) - search in trie
* **Tree**
  * `C++` [Suffix Tree](tree/suffix-tree)
